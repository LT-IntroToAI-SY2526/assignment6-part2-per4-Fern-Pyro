## Question 1: Feature Importance

Based on your house price model, rank the four features from most important to least important. Explain how you determined this ranking.

**YOUR ANSWER:**
1. Most Important: Square Feet
2. Bedrooms
3. Bathrooms
4. Least Important: Age

SqaureFeet vs Price has the strongest correclation, as demonstarted by the mostly linear graph. “Bedrooms vs Price” and “Bathrooms vs Price” have a similar level of  correlation between the two variables, but because “Bedrooms vs Price” appears to have more data points I ranked it slightly higher. The Age vs Price graph demostrated little to no correlation between the two variables (a linear BFL would be mostly inacrruate to the actual data points).
